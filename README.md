# Machine Learning Workflow Example

This Jupyter Notebook project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset. The notebook covers data loading, exploration, preparation, model selection, training, prediction, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sri-Hari2003/machine-learning-workflow.git
   cd machine-learning-workflow
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook proj.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells to observe the workflow steps.

## Project Structure

- `proj.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the machine learning workflow code.
- `iris.csv`: The Iris dataset used in the example.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository directory.

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook proj.ipynb
   ```

3. Interact with the notebook cells to execute each step of the workflow.
